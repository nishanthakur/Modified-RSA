# Modified-RSA
Modified-RSA is a modified version of RSA. The modification in RSA was necessary to improve its security level. A simple script namely "modified_rsa.py" was written using python programming language for calculating the public key are private key for Modified-RSA. Alongside a script to calculate the public key and the private key for RSA algorithm is also included in this repository in the name of "rsa.py". 

# Usage
Step 01: Either clone or download the zip file of this repository.
Step 02: Execute the "modified_rsa.py" file.
Step 03: Select three large random prime numbers.
Step 04: Calculate public key.
Step 05: Derive private key using the value of public key.
